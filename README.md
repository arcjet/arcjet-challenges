# Arcjet Security Challenges

Welcome to the Arcjet Security Challenges repository! This project contains skeleton apps for four popular web frameworks, each designed to help you learn about implementing rate limiting with Arcjet.

## Frameworks

This repository includes challenges for the following frameworks:

1. [Next.js](./nextjs)
2. [Node.js with Express](./express)
3. [Bun](./bun)
4. [SvelteKit](./sveltekit)

## The Challenge

Your mission is to implement rate limiting using Arcjet in one (or more!) of these skeleton apps. Once you've successfully implemented rate limiting, share evidence of your success on social media. If your post is part of an active competition, you might be eligible to win a prize!

## Getting Started

To begin the challenge:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/arcjet/arcjet-challenges.git`

2. Choose the framework you want to work with and navigate to its directory.

3. Follow the specific instructions in the README.md file within each framework's directory to set up and run the skeleton app.

4. Implement rate limiting using Arcjet. You can find documentation and guides at [docs.arcjet.com](https://docs.arcjet.com).

5. Once you've successfully implemented rate limiting, capture evidence of your success (e.g., a screenshot or video of the rate-limited response).

6. Share your success on social media, tagging @arcjethq and using the hashtag #ArcjetChallenge.

## Need Help?

If you run into any issues or have questions about the challenge:

- Check out the [Arcjet documentation](https://docs.arcjet.com)
- Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/TPra6jqZDC) for real-time support
- Open an issue in this repository if you think you've found a bug in the skeleton apps

## Good Luck!

We're excited to see your implementations. Happy coding, and may the best rate limiter win!
